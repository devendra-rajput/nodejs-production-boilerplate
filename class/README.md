# 🏗️ Class-Based Node.js Production Boilerplate

Welcome to the **Class-Based** implementation of the Node.js Production Boilerplate. This directory contains reliable, scalable, and production-ready codebases built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## 📂 Project Structure

This folder is organized by database technology to suit your specific stack requirements:

### ✨ [MongoDB (Mongoose)](./mongo-db)
A fully configured setup for **NoSQL** applications.
- **Features**: connection pooling, schema validation, aggregation pipelines, and class-based models.
- **Best For**: High-volume data, flexible schemas, and rapid prototyping.

### ✨ [MySQL (Sequelize/Relational)](./mysql)
A robust setup for **Relational** data management.
- **Features**: SQL optimizations, transaction management, strict schema definitions, and ORM integration.
- **Best For**: Structured data, complex relationships, and ACID compliance transactions.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the directory of your chosen database:
    ```bash
    cd mongo-db
    # or
    cd mysql
    ```
2.  Follow the specific `README.md` inside that folder for installation and configuration steps.
3.  Enjoy a structured, OOP-driven development experience!
